                Do you like that beach in the background?  Do you?  I got you don't I ;)... I like it too.  Well if
                you want to get to a beach like this one then development with asp.net is for you.  I know... that was corny,
                but I was trying to figure out what I wanted to say to start this thing off and a little sarcasm doesn't hurt.  My name is Jamar and I will be
                going over how to start with asp.net.  There was something called .net framework in the past, that is still used somewhat, but
                has since turned into .net core which is a smaller and faster version of .net framework.  The .net stack allows
                developers to run c# in the browseeeeeer... duh duh DUUUUUUUUUH!  Too dramatic, alright...  I want to also point out
                that I have a youtube series 
                <a style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(38, 255, 0);" target="_blank" 
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNy6-YQFPKg&list=PLVav1OdY3ZMsqSEJh6-ONX1-uNuHHtRw_">here</a> 
                that goes over asp.net as well and is complementary with this blog.  BE WARNED, please git clone the repo I have linked
                to the videos, or you can click 
                <a style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(38, 255, 0);" target="_blank"

                , first before watching because I made a mistake by putting some business logic (logic code) in the controllers,
                but after the series I moved it to a singleton helper class.  This is because the controllers got instantiated each time they
                were called so the variables were getting recreated and no data was being saved.  By the way, if
                you are new to C# I have a C# for beginners playlist on my youtube channel as well for you

                .  Okay, so I'm going to split this blog into sections so that you can go between each part with convenience
                and so it will make more sense.
